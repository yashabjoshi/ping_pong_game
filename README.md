This project implements a classic Ping Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics. Players control paddles on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The game tracks scores for both players and resets the ball's position when it goes out of bounds. This simple yet engaging game helps players practice hand-eye coordination. The scoreboard displays the current score for both players, updating in real-time as points are scored. Players can move their paddles up and down using designated keys, while the ball moves and bounces off the paddles and walls.
